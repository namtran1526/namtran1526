## 💫 About Me  

I am a Computer Science student at VNU University of Engineering and Technology (UET) with a strong interest in data analytics, business analysis, and business intelligence.

I am not only interested in writing code, but more passionate about understanding how technology supports business decision making. I enjoy analyzing problems, structuring information, and transforming data into insights that can be understood by non-technical people.

My long-term goal is to become a hybrid professional who can work as an IT Business Analyst, Data Analyst, and BI Developer. I want to be the person who connects business requirements with technical solutions using data.

I believe that good analysis is not only about numbers, but also about understanding people, processes, and business objectives.

My mindset:

Think like a Business Analyst.  
Analyze like a Data Analyst.  
Visualize like a BI Developer.

Outside of technology, I am a curious learner who enjoys exploring how business, marketing, and consumer behavior interact with data.

Language:  
Vietnamese (Native)  
English (Basic – improving for global working environment)
