## 💫 About Me  

🎓 I am a Computer Science student at **VNU University of Engineering and Technology (UET)**.

📊 I am passionate about using **data to support business decision making**. What attracts me to Data Analytics, Business Analysis, and Business Intelligence is the ability to rely on data to analyze situations, evaluate options, and help businesses choose the right direction for sustainable growth.

💡 I am more interested in **business impact** than pure technology. I believe data only becomes valuable when it helps people make better decisions.

🎯 My long-term goal is to become a **hybrid professional** who can work as an IT Business Analyst, Data Analyst, and BI Developer, connecting business requirements with technical solutions through structured analysis and data visualization.
